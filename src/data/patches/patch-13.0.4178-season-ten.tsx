  "Spring is officially here, and Age of Empires IV is almost ready to blossom with a new ranked season! This update brings with it a fresh map pool and a bundle of balance changes, along with the kickoff of Ranked Season Ten. Be on the lookout for the Clash of Champions mini event, along with a unique new map feature.
Alongside this update, we will be releasing the Knights of Cross and Rose DLC across all platforms! Players can look forward to two new variant civilizations, the valorous Knights Templar and the ever-capable House of Lancaster. Additionally, the DLC will contain the new Historical Battles game mode, ten unique maps, and new achievements.
