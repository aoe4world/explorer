"October brings both tricks and treats to Age of Empires IV with the upcoming Season Nine Update – coming October 22nd! Our seasonal biome Hallow’s Hearth makes a return, and with it comes a fun (or frightening) twist on the wolf unit with the Full Moon game mode. Not only that, but we’re officially launching Multiplayer Pause, along with a bundle of balance changes, there’s also two new maps arriving with this update."`,
