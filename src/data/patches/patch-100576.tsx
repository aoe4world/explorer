## Quick Match Updates

- The Nomad Game Mode was added as a new option and comes with several improvements. 
- A new Free for All option has been added, allowing you to queue for 8 Player free for all matches. 
    - Quick match Free for All matches are played using the new “Dominion” win condition. 

### A Note on Leaderboards and Hidden Elo

Free For All will have a new leaderboard and track your hidden Elo separately, this means that matchmaking will result in more balanced games over time. In FFA mode, the winner is the only player to gain Elo and all other players lose Elo based on an even split equal to the amount of Elo that the winner gains.

Additionally, Nomad mode will share a leaderboard with Standard Mode. This means that when you queue for Nomad for the first time, you’ll be more likely to be matched with players close to your skill level.

## Nomad Improvements

- Starting Villagers increased from 3 to 5.
- Villagers’ starting distance increased.
- Holy Roman Empire Prelate, Zhu Xi’s Legacy Official, and Mongols Ger are granted upon Town Center construction and not at the start of the match.
- English Villager bows and Chinese Villager build speed bonus are deactivated at the start of the game, reactivated upon Town Center construction.
- Jeanne d’Arc Civilization starts with 3 Villagers plus Jeanne d’Arc.
- Order of the Dragon Civilization starts with 4 Villagers.

## New “Dominion” Win Condition

- Enabled/disabled in custom games via the Game Mode Win Conditions section (disabled by default).
- Compatible with Standard, Empire Wars, and Nomad Game Modes as well as all other win condition types.
- Players start with a Monarch that must be protected at all costs, losing a Monarch leads to the instant elimination of the owning player.
    - Eliminating an enemy Monarch grants +50 maximum population.
    - If a player is eliminated by Landmark victory, their Monarch remains on the field. Eliminating a neutral Monarch continues to grant +50 maximum population.
- Monarchs have two primary abilities:
    - Sprint: Temporarily move faster.
    - Treason: Reveal the location of enemy Monarchs and ping them on the minimap.
- Monarchs are visible on the minimap with a crown icon.
- AI players will garrison their Monarch into a safe building.
- When loading into a game with no other players or AI, the Dominion win condition will automatically deactivate and not spawn a Monarch at the start.

## Quality of Life Improvements

- Walls under construction can now be converted into gates via an ability on the placed blueprint. Conversion to a gate can happen at any time before the wall section is finished construction, after which it is no longer possible to convert directly, and a Villager must be used. The cost of the conversion is the difference between the cost of the wall and gate. 
- When ungarrisoning from a building, units will exit the building from the location closest to the rally point direction.

      ### AI

      - AI players now have a unique identifying number in the pinned player information.
      - AI villagers now flee when attacked by enemy units.
      - Corrected an issue where certain buildings would prioritize Battering Rams as targets.
      - Japanese AI now makes better use of Shinobi units.
      - Malian AI no longer get hyper focused on building a pit mine to the exclusion of all else.
      - Fixed an issue with Mongol AI not unpacking their starting Town Center.
      - Byzantine AI now place more cisterns.
      - Ottoman AI will no longer turn off military school production.
      - Easy AI no longer produces more than one Scout.
      
      > We have found that Easy AI can sometimes be too efficient at using Scouts to explore and take Sheep at this difficulty. We hope this change allows players to have more chances at securing Sheep when exploring the map.
      
      - Adjusted how the Easy and Intermediate AI chooses to advance to the next Age.
      - Easy AI is now adaptive, speeding up or slowing down its Age-up based on the other players in the match. The Easy AI will never surpass the Age of another player in the game.
      - Intermediate AI Ages up slower but can also adapt to faster Age-ups and catch up if needed.
      - Easy AI can now research Wheelbarrow and tier 1 economy technologies.
      - Easy AI can now research tier 1 Blacksmith technologies.
      - Intermediate AI can now only research tier 1 and 2 economy technologies.
      - Intermediate AI can now research tier 1 and 2 Blacksmith technologies.
      - Hard AI can now research all economy technologies.
      - Developer Note: Easy and Intermediate AI are being tuned to help players with ramp up in difficulty. The Easy AI would previously Age up too slow where the Intermediate AI would do so too fast. Additionally, Intermediate AI would research much more Blacksmith, economy, and other technologies compared to the Easy AI. These changes aim to create a more natural difficulty progression.
      
      ### Audio
      
      - Improved Simplified Chinese voice overs in The Sultans Ascend cinematics.

      ### General
      
      - Shore Fish can no longer be permanently removed when placing structures on them and will automatically return when the building is deleted or destroyed. 
      - Fixed an issue where Villagers seeking shelter would sometimes fail to choose the nearest available Outpost for shelter. 
      - When unloading units from a garrison, they now exit on the side closest to their destination. 
      - It’s now easier to target a live animal with a Villager when the animal overlaps a construction plan. 
      - Fixed an exploit where Monks could duplicate Relics when removing them from Monasteries. 
      - Fixed an issue where Lightweight Beams would not reduce construction times for some civilizations. 
      - Previously, if a siege unit lost sight of a building it was attacking, it would go idle. Now it will move closer to regain vision and resume its attack. 
      - Fixed a bug where Deer would get stuck together after colliding. 
      - Landmarks no longer retain their garrison arrows after being destroyed and repaired. 
      - Now, if a Siege Tower or Ram containing units passes over a stamped building, it will not cancel the building.

      - Fixed a bug where Villagers would idle instead of returning to work when their previous job was gathering from a Boar. 
      - Explosive Ship kills are now counted in post-game statistics. 
      - The post-game statistics now correctly reflect units lost when a Transport Ship sinks.  
      - Units inside a Ram or Siege Tower inside a Transport Ship will now die if the ship is destroyed. 
      - Fixed a crash that could occur when exiting the Acre mission. 
      - The Inna Jiffy cheat now applies to Ayyubid cavalry and Ghulam units. 
      - Fixed a crash that could happen when playing on Canal with two teams of unequal player count. 
      - Fixed an issue where water borders were harsh or jagged on some maps. 
      - Fixed an issue with Forts where the wrong size of map was used for team games. This caused starting bases to overlap with enemies and allies in rare cases.  
      - Fixed an issue with Black Forest where the wrong size was used for solo and team games. This caused the middle lanes to be generated incorrectly. 
      - Fixed an issue with Migration where the wrong size was used for team games. This created a much smaller island to fight over once you have migrated to the main island. 
      - Fixed a crash that could occur when entering a match. 
      - Fixed a crash that could occur when switching control groups quickly while mousing over the command card.

      - Changed “Test of Strength” challenges from requiring the defeat of AI to winning games with the associated civilization.
