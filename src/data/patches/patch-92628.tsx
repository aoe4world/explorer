      ## Xbox Update: Xbox Home Share
      After we launched The Sultans Ascend expansion last year, we heard that Xbox Home share wasn’t working as expecting. This has been fixed in this latest update.
      
      ## Design Update
      - Our main focus this update has been to improve the balance of new Civilizations.
      - The Japanese sacred choice design has been reworked, with six new technologies that are unlocked at either the Shinto Shrine or Buddhist Temple; based on your Castle Age Landmark selection.
      
      ##Crash Fixes
      We’ve identified and fixed a number of high frequency crashes and desyncs, this should lead to better game stability with this update.

      ### Masteries
      
      - Fixed a bug where Delhi Sultanate Mastery #10, “Protecting the Sword” was not correctly tracking healing from the Mosque’s healing aura. The mastery was undercounting health received.

      ### Localization
      
      We have been tracking your feedback relating to localization quality in _The Sultans Ascend_ expansion and have made expansive changes to several languages, including Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Hungarian languages.
      
      We are committed to continuing to track and evaluate improvements in this space. So, please let us know in [the forums](https://forums.ageofempires.com/t/incorrect-translations-for-age-of-empires-iv-the-sultans-ascend-dlc/243544) if you continue to see issues related to language quality.

      ## Map-Specific Changes

### African Waters 

- Player’s starting gold will no longer spawn trapped inside the player’s starting forest.

### Hill & Dale 

- We’ve done a tuning pass on the distribution of Sacred Sites on Hill and Dale. We have more robust changes coming in a future update that should help ensure that sites are placed fairly with even higher consistency, but we felt like this interim tuning has resulted in less clumped spawns than before.

### Gorge

- Sheep distribution has been reworked on Gorge and Forts to be more consistent across the map, with less cases of 2/3 sheep spawning bunched together while other large areas remain arid.

          note: `The above set of changes to Siege aims to help with late-game stalemate situations and address a couple of issues with Springalds and Culverins:
        1. Volatility of Springalds and Culverins vs other Siege units. By increasing the attack speed and reducing damage, it now requires more Springalds and Culverins to be able to one-shot other Siege weapons. This should widen the window available to react to seeing these units on the battlefield before all your attacking siege is destroyed.  
        2. Camping under Keeps with Springalds and Culverins surrounded by units makes them difficult to push into and pick off, but without picking them off it is challenging to use siege to take down the Keep. By reducing the ranged armor of the Springald, we hope that using ranged units to pick them off becomes more viable.`,

        ## Known Issues
        Known Issue with Byzantine Rain of Fire Mastery: It is possible for buildings to be destroyed by normal fire (from taking damage) before either the trebuchet or Greek Fire damage can deliver the final blow. This can result in buildings not counting towards the mastery. Try using more trebuchets against single buildings to increase the odds of that building counting towards the mastery. Additionally, landmarks do not count as destroyed (as they can be rebuilt)
